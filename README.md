## Formatting

-   To change formatting rules, go to .editorconfig file in the root folder. To enforce a rule across the whole project, install dotnet format: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format` then run `dotnet format`. Be mindful of how this affect others in the project.
-   **Setup**: In vs code install the extension "EditorConfig for VS Code". For Visual Studio the setting “Enable EditorConfig support” must be turned on (which is the default).
